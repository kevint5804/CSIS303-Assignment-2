The first part uses a linked list to store animal names and the second part uses a stack to store numbers.

Single linked list
The user will be able to see how the animal list changes step by step and demonstrate the different functions.
Explanation of the single linked list functions:
push_front adds a new animal to the front of the list
push_back adds a new animal to the back of the list
pop_front removes the first animal in the list
pop_back removes the last animal in the list
insert lets the user add an animal at the index position
remove deletes an animal at the index position
find searches the list to find an animal and returns its index position
front shows the first animal in the list
back shows the last animal in the list
empty checks if there are any animals on the list

Stack
The user will also see the creation of a stack with integers utilizing vectors that demonstrate different functions.
Explanation of the stack functions:
push adds a number to the top of the stack
pop removes the number on top of the stack
top shows the number on top of the stack
average calculates the average of the numbers in the stack
print shows all the numbers in the stack going from bottom to top
empty checks if there are any number in the stack

INSTRUCTIONS
When the program starts, it will create a list and check if it is empty. Follow the prompts:
1. Type 3 animal names to add to the list (one at a time). This will utilize push_front 3 times and start your list off.
2. Type 2 more animal names to add to the list. This will utilize push_back and add them to the back of your list.
3. The program will then remove the first and last animal on the list.
4. Enter the name of an animal you want to insert into the list. After that, enter an index position where you want to insert the animal name.
5. Enter the index to remove the animal at that index position.
6. Enter the name of the animal you want to find on the list. If the animal is on the list, the program will return its index position.
7. The program will check if the list is empty again at this point.

Afterwards, the program will create a stack and demonstrate its functions.
It will:
1. Create a stack
2. Check if the stack is empty
3. Push and pop a series of numbers
4. Print the stack
5. Print the number on top of the stack
6. Calculate the average of the stack
7. Check if the stack is empty
